			<div class="card"><h1>Don't wash your hair or take a bath when you're menstruating:</h1>
			There is absolutely no reason not to wash your hair, or shower during menstruation. In fact,
			a nice warm bath can do a lot to relieve menstrual cramps and premenstrual tension.
			</div>
			<div class="card"><h1>You need to wash your pads before throwing them out. Otherwise ghosts 
			will come and haunt you:</h1>There is absolutely no need to do so. Disposable pads should be discarded
			after use. Ghosts don't have time to hunt used pads.
			</div>
			<div class="card"><h1>Periods are shameful, dirty and impure:</h1>
			Women on their periods are not dirty or unclean. Being on your period is not something to be 
			ashamed of or to be kept a secret. In fact we should try to talk more openly about
			periods so that we get proper sanitation facilities and correct information.</div>
			<div class="card"><h1>You can't do exercise and should only rest when you're on
			your period:</h1>It is a myth that exercising can worsen period cramps. There is no scientific
			reason for a woman with a normal cycle to stop exercising while she's on her period.
			</div>
			<div class="card"><h1>Girls having their periods should not touch or go near plants. The 
			plants will die if they do so:</h1>
			This doesn't even need an explanation(duh!). Clearly a MYTH.
			</div>
			<div class="card"><h1>Sour foods can worsen cramps:</h1>
			 It is essential for women to maintain
			a healthier diet during periods, but there is no connection between menstrual cramps and eating sour foods.
