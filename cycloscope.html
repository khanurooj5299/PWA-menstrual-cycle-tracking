		<div class="card" id="d1">
			<div>The first day of your cycle begins with the day your period starts. Estrogen is at its lowest, and since
			estrogen is responsible for increasing serotonin(the "feel-good" chemical), you may be feeling pretty lousy today.
				
			</div>
			<div><img src="./images/gifs/d1.GIF"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" id="d2">
			<div>On average, the second yields the heaviest flow. Also the start of your period can bring killer cramps, all thanks
			to the presence of prostanglandins, so make sure you are taking extra time for self-care. You can check the tips section
			to know how to relieve cramps.
			</div>
			<div><img src="./images/gifs/d2.GIF"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" id="d3">
			<div>Your brain is greatly influenced by fluctuations in your hormone levels. That's why you are probably having
			mood swings and low self-esteem.
			</div>
			<div><img src="./images/gifs/d3.GIF"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" id="d4">
			<div>With all those tampons, pads and extra blood flow, your vaginal PH has increased, which can lead to
			increased susceptibility to yeast infections.
			</div>
			<div><img src="./images/gifs/d4.GIF"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" id="d5">
			<div>Today your period should be a helluva lot lighter - the end is near!
			You may be feeling a bit more relaxed as estrogen levels start climbing again.
			</div>
			<div><img src="./images/gifs/d5.GIF"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" id="d6">
			<div>Why do you feel so good, you ask? Because science! Serotonin levels are increasing right along
			with your estrogen, babe. And serotonin has an important job - to make you feel GOOD.
			</div>
			<div><img src="./images/gifs/d6.GIF"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" id="d7">
			<div>You're almost through your flow. All the ugly period symptoms have vanished and you're feeling like
			yourself again.

		</div>
		<div class="card" id="d8">
			<div>Crossed the finish line! Thank the heavens, and shove your sanitary products to the back of the cabinet.
			You won't be needing those for a while. Also your mind is super sharp right now because of the increased blood flow to 
			your brain. The end of your flow makes your memory and ability to process information even more precise.

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="card" id="d10">
			<div> These follicles are growing and preparing to release an egg. As the eggs start to develop, they produce estrogen,
